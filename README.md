Stroke is a medical emergency. A stroke occurs when blood flow to a part of your brain is interrupted or reduced, preventing brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients.
Brain cells begin to die within minutes. The main objective is to analyze the dataset and to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status with the machine learning algorithms .
Each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient.
